    "ground_truth": "In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include:\r\n\r\n1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.\r\n2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin.\r\n3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin.\r\n\r\nFor the third quarter of 2023, the Products gross margin percentage increased compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness and decreased leverage. However, the year-over-year Products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to the weakness in foreign currencies and decreased leverage, despite cost savings and a different Products mix.\r\n\r\nThe Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies and higher Services costs. The Services gross margin percentage decreased due to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\r\n\r\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf",

    "ground_truth": "Yes, there has been a change in Apple's operating expenses over the reported quarters. The key drivers for this change are increases in research and development (\"R&D\") expense and selling, general and administrative expense.

    "ground_truth": "The legal proceedings disclosed in the provided 10-Q documents include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Epic Games Lawsuit: Epic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based on Apple's operation of its App Store. The District Court ruled in favor of Apple on most counts but found that certain provisions of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines violated California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's ruling. Further appeals and requests for review are mentioned, including a potential appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Circuit Court's stay of the injunction pending such appeal.\r\n\r\n2. European Commission State Aid Decision: The European Commission issued a decision that Ireland granted state aid to Apple by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two Apple subsidiaries. The decision ordered Ireland to recover additional taxes from Apple for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Both Apple and Ireland appealed the decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which annulled the decision. The European Commission appealed the annulment to the European Court of Justice, and a hearing was held with a decision expected in calendar year 2024.\r\n\r\nThese legal proceedings and contingencies could potentially impact Apple in several ways:\r\n\r\n- The Epic Games lawsuit could lead to changes in Apple's App Store policies and practices, particularly regarding the prohibition of developers from including external links to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. If the injunction takes effect, it could impact Apple's App Store revenue and operating model.\r\n- The European Commission State Aid Decision could result in Apple being required to pay additional taxes for the specified period if the appeal by the European Commission is successful. Apple believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the decision.\r\n\r\nBoth matters could have financial implications for Apple, including potential monetary liabilities and changes to business practices that could affect future revenue and profitability.\r\n\r\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q1 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q2 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf",
